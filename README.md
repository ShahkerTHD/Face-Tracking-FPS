# Why I Made This Simple Project

As someone who travels extensively, I understand the importance of productivity in every aspect of life. This year, my resolution was to enhance my productivity, and I embarked on creating a project that aligns with this goal. Initially, I aimed to develop a health and productivity application, but I felt that the time wasn't quite right for such a complex endeavor. Instead, I decided to tackle a simpler yet intriguing challenge.

## The Concept: Neck and Head Movement Exercise

The idea behind my project revolves around the benefits of exercising the muscles around the neck. Improved blood flow through the spinal cord can significantly enhance posture and overall well-being. Given the state of our posture today, I saw an opportunity to create something meaningful and engaging. My mom is a doctor and my father an Architect and both fields have been bestowed on me so in the future I have big ideas for this. (Its a wonderful handwriting combo isnt it ðŸ˜‚)

### Project Requirements

My project had three main requirements:

1. **Lightweight**: The final product needed to be so lightweight that I could simply open the HTML file without needing to host it or worry about storage space on my thumb drive.

2. **Simplicity**: The project had to be straightforward enough for me to work on while simultaneously conducting research on the topic.

3. **Incorporation of New Technology**: I wanted to explore a new technology and incorporate it into my project. Specifically, I chose to use "ThreeJS," a powerful library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. Despite being proficient in 3D modeling and having created several popular designs, I had never considered integrating these models into a web environment.

This project represents a blend of personal interest, technological exploration, and a commitment to self-improvement. By focusing on a simple yet impactful concept, I hope to contribute positively to the lives of others who share similar interests and challenges.
